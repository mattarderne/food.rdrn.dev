## Ingredients
- 1 lemon
- 2 red onions
- 1 red pepper
- 10g mint
- 1 courgette
- 1 Tb ras el hanout spice
- 130g quinoa (can also use couscous)
- 200g halloumi cheese
- Olive oil
- Salt

## Method
 **Roast veg:**
- Preheat the oven to 190°C/ 170°C (fan).
- Chop onions, red pepper and courgette.
- Add the chopped vegetables to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt.
- Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the vegetables are soft and slightly brown.

 **Make quinoa:**
- Add the quinoa to a pot with a matching lid, with 250ml cold water, a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat.
- Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 18-20 min or until all the water has absorbed and the quinoa is tender.

 **Make dressing:**
- While the quinoa is cooking, combine the juice of 1/2 lemon in a bowl with 2 tbsp olive oil and mix well - this is your lemon dressing
