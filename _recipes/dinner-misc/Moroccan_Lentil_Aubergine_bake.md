## Ingredients
**Moroccan lentils**
-  1 cup green lentils and 2 cups water or a can of lentils
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1/2 medium onion
- 1 large red pepper (fine if you don't have this)
- 2 Tbsp tomato paste
- 1 1/2 Tbsp coconut sugar (or normal sugar)
- 1/2 tsp sea salt
- 1 Tbsp smoked or sweet paprika
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 1/2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (or lemon juice)
- 1 bunch fresh coriander
- 1 tin chopped tomatoes

**Aubergine bake**
- 2 big aubergines
- 2 slices of bread
- Bunch of coriander
- 1 Tbs olive oil

## Method
**Make Moroccan lentils:**
- If not using tinned lentils: Cook lentils first by bringing water to a boil and adding lentils. Bring back to a boil. Then reduce heat to low and simmer (uncovered) for about 20 minutes or until lentils are tender.
- Lightly fry onion and garlic until soft.
-  NutriBullet cooked onion and garlic bell pepper, tomato paste, coconut sugar, sea salt, paprika, cumin, coriander, ginger, turmeric, cayenne pepper, and apple cider vinegar. Mix to thoroughly combine. (You can add a bit of water at the end to get all the goodness out of the NutriBullet).
- Taste and adjust flavour as needed, adding more tomato paste for depth of flavour, spices for more overall flavour (especially coriander and paprika), cayenne for heat, coconut sugar for sweetness, apple cider vinegar for acidity, or salt for saltiness. Set aside.
- Once the lentils have cooked, drain off any excess liquid and then add spice mixture and parsley or cilantro and mix well to combine.
- Put back in the pot, add the tin of tomatoes and another 1/2 tsp smoked paprika. Allow to reduce for about 20 minutes. 

**Prepare aubergines and breadcrumb topping**
- Preheat oven to 190 C/ 180 fan
- Slice the aubergines in disks if creating a layered bake or long strips if rolling. 
- Roast aubergine for 20 minutes, turning over at 10 minutes until golden brown on both sides.
- Toast bread and let cool. NutriBullet pieces of toast and bunch of coriander. At the end, mix in 1 Tbs of olive oil. 

**Make aubergine bake**
- If making a layered bake: layer aubergine disks and Moroccan lentils ending on lentils.
- If rolling: roll each slice of aubergine with lentils inside and add a Tbs of lentils on each roll. 
- Sprinkle coriander breadcrumbs over the top and bake for about 20 minutes until golden on-top. 

_Serve as is or over rice o. Garnish with fresh coriander._
