## Ingredients
- 2 cups leftover risotto (any will work)
- 100 g mozzarella cut into 1cm cubes (optional)
- 1 cup home-made wholewheat breadcrumbs (whole wheat toast in NutriBullet)
- 1 tsp dried oregano
-  1 tsp dried parsley
-   ½  tsp smoked paprika
-   ½  tsp sea salt
-   pinch black pepper
-   ½  cup whole wheat flour/white plain flour
-   2 eggs beaten

## Method
- Preheat to oven to 220C and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Make up your breadcrumb mixture by mixing the breadcrumbs with the oregano, parsley, smoked paprika, salt and pepper.
- Have 3 medium bowls, fill one bowl with the whole wheat flour, one bowl with the beaten eggs and the remaining bowl with the breadcrumb mixture.
- Take one heaped tablespoon of risotto, and roll it into a ball. Take one piece of the cubed mozzarella and push it into the rice ball if using cheese. Fix it back into a round shape and continue with the rest of the risotto.
- Take each ball, roll in the flour, shake off excess, roll in the egg, and then in the breadcrumb mixture. Place on the pre-prepared baking tray, and continue will all the rice balls.
- Bake for about 10-15 minutes, when the breadcrumbs are nice and crunchy on the outside, and the cheese is all melted and gooey on the inside
-   Serve with some marinara (tin of tomatoes, sugar, S&P and Italian spice) and enjoy.
