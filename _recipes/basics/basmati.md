## Method
- Rinse the dry rice in a sieve under running water if preferred (I tend not to).

- For each cup of rice, add 1.5 cups of water.
- Add a generous splash of olive oil and a chunk of butter.
- Add salt, pepper and spices to preference.
- Get to a boil, put the lid on, and leave to simmer at low heat for 15 minutes.
- Turn off the heat and leave to simmer for a further 10 minutes.
- Take off the lid and fluff with a fork before serving.
