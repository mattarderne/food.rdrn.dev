title: Sourdough Starter
source: 
yield: 1 bubbly starter
time: 1 week
notes: 
ingredients:
- 50g All Purpose flour
- 50g water (filtered, lukewarm)
- Jar of around 600-1000ml, weigh the jar so you have an empty baseline, and mark a few 1/2 cup lines
method:
- Get started with this link - https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/sourdough-starter-recipe
- Maintenance Feeding":"
- once a week is fine, if it starts to smell super alcoholy then it needs a feed. Fridge slows down how often it needs to be fed
- Feed them equal amounts starter, flour and filtered lukewarm water
- (I usually do 60g of each, but the only important thing is that you do equal amounts flour and water added, as you want to keep the water % consistent)
- Feeding ritual":"
- Take out fridge 
- Throw out enough so that after feeding there’ll be enough space to at least double
- Weigh and add the flour and water, mix up neatly 
- Leave for an hour then throw in fridge, with an elastic at the level
- Then when you want to bake, feed it but don’t put it in the fridge, then use it in your recipe when it’s doubled in size
