## Ingredients
**Filling**
- 750g rhubarb, sliced into thumb-size chunks
- 140g caster sugar
- juice 1 large orange

**Pastry**
- 1 1/4 cup (125g) almond flour
- 1 cup (90g) oats
- 1/2 cup (170g) honey
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 5 Tbs (65g) unsalted butter, softened at room temperature

**Streusel topping**
- ¼ tsp ground cinnamon
- 2/3 cup (140g) cold butter, diced
- 1 cup (100g) ground almond
- 1 cup + 2Tbs (140g ) plain flour
- 7/8 cup (175g) brown sugar
- Handful flaked almonds

## Method
**Filling**
- Preheat the oven to (180°C). Tip the rhubarb into a roasting tray with the sugar and juice, then toss together.
- Tip into a sieve over a bowl, then reserve the syrup.
- While the rhubarb is cooking start the pastry case. 

**Streusel topping**
- Rub the topping ingredients, except the almonds, together until crumbly. 

**Pastry case**
- Oven should still be preheated from filling. Lightly grease a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Set aside.
- Combine almond flour, oats, honey, baking powder, and salt. Add softened butter and use your fingers until coarse crumbs form and the mixture holds together when pressed.
- Pour the pastry into the tin and press the dough evenly into the pan. Poke with a fork in the middle a few times.
- Blind bake for 20 minutes.
- Remove from the oven and pour in the roasted rhubard mixture (not the syrup)
- Crumble the topping over the rhubard. Scatter with almonds, then bake for 20 mins. 


_Leave the tart until just warm, then turn out and serve with the rhubarb syrup and some crème fraîche/yogurt/coconut yogurt._
