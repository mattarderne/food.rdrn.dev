## Ingredients
Dough Ingredients:
- 450 g all-purpose flour
- 1 tp salt
- 40 grams sugar
- 230 ml water
- 150 g doubled sourdough starter With a low acid content (fed regularly)
- 50 g unsalted butter room temperature

Butter packet:
- 250 g unsalted butter room temperature
- 1.5 Tb flour

Egg Wash
- 1 medium egg + 1 Tb water

## Method
**Step 1**
- Prepare dough by mixing together all the dough ingredients and use your hands to form a sticky dough ball. Knead the dough on the bench for 5-8 minutes until you create a smooth ball.
- Then cover with a damp towel and leave to ferment for three hours (at a room temperature between 21-23°C) before transferring to the fridge overnight.

**Step 2**
- Mix together the 1.5 Tbsp flour and 250g butter, then roll it into a rectangle of about 20 x 30cm, in between two sheets of baking paper.
- Place in the fridge for a few minutes so it is cool. However ensure it is still nice and pliable. Aim for the butter and the dough to be similar consistencies.
- Take the dough and on a floured bench, roll it into a rectangle double the size of the butter packet. Place the butter packet on the bottom end of the dough and fold over the top end. Fold the sides over to tuck in the butter.
- Use a rolling pin to gently press a few times along the length of the dough to help disperse the butter. 
- Roll the butter and dough out flat into a long rectangle before folding into thirds. Now let the dough rest for 20-30 minutes in the fridge or on the bench.
- Turn the dough 90 degrees and roll it out in front you and repeat the folding process. Let it rest for 20-30 minutes.
- Repeat this step once more (that’s three times in total.)
- After the last fold, chill the dough for 2 hours before rolling into a long rectangle. Cut the rectangle into long triangles of about 10 cm width and 25 cm height. Roll the triangles up tightly, starting from the bottom and rolling up to the tip.
- Leave the rolled croissants to proof, for approximately 4 hours on the bench (at a room temperature between 21-23°C) until puffy.

**Step 3**
- I usually place these croissants in the fridge overnight and bake them the following morning. This is because it works out well in my schedule, to have fresh croissants for breakfast. Plus, the extra fridge proof gives them more sourdough flavour.
- However, they can be baked right away after their bench rest. They will be slightly milder in flavour which is good if you don’t like a tangy croissant. If your room is quite warm and they are very soft after their bench rise, pop them in the fridge to firm up again slightly before baking. 
- Heat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius fan-bake or 220 degrees Celsius regular bake. Brush the croissant tops with the eggwash.
- Bake for around 20 minutes or until deep golden brown. How fast they bake will depend on how big they were shaped. If the croissants are browning too quickly, turn the oven down during the bake.
