## Ingredients
-  ⅓ cup (75 grams) melted coconut oil 
-   ½ cup honey (168 grams) 
-   2 eggs
-   1 cup (225 grams) mashed ripe bananas (about 2 ½ medium or 2 large bananas)
-   ¼ cup (56 grams) milk of choice or water
-   1 tsp baking soda 
-   1 tsp  vanilla extract
-   ½ tsp  salt
-   ½ tsp ground cinnamon, plus more to swirl on top
-   1 ¾ cups (220 grams) whole wheat flour (can use white flour)
-   Optional: ½ cup mix-ins like chopped walnuts or pecans, chocolate chips, raisins, chopped dried fruit, fresh banana slices…

## Method
-   Preheat oven to 165 degrees Celsius and grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan.
- In a large bowl, beat the oil and honey together with a whisk. Add the eggs and beat well, then whisk in the mashed bananas and milk. (If your coconut oil solidifies on contact with cold ingredients, simply let the bowl rest in a warm place for a few minutes, like on top of your stove, or warm it for about 10 seconds in the microwave.)
- Add the baking soda, vanilla, salt and cinnamon, and whisk to blend. Lastly, switch to a big spoon and stir in the flour, just until combined.  If you’re adding any additional mix-ins, gently fold them in now.
-  Pour the batter into your greased loaf pan and sprinkle lightly with cinnamon. If you’d like a pretty swirled effect, run the tip of a knife across the batter in a zig-zag pattern.
-  Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
- Let the bread cool in the loaf pan for at least 10 minutes.  Carefully transfer the loaf to a wire rack to cool before slicing.
