## Ingredients
**Chocolate Layer**
- 150g 70% dark chocolate
- 1 tsp coconut oil
  
**Peanut Butter Filling**
- 1/2 cup smooth peanut butter
- 1 Tbsp honey 
- 1 Tbsp coconut oil, melted
- 1/2 tsp vanilla
- Pinch of salt

## Method
- Line a mini muffin tray with cupcake cases.
- Break the chocolate into pieces and place in a microwave safe bowl along with the coconut oil. Microwave for 30 second increments, stirring after each time, until the chocolate is completely melted.
- Spoon 1 teaspoon of melted chocolate into each cupcake case, swirling it around so that the chocolate can run to the top of the cupcake case. This forms the “cup” in which the peanut butter filling will be.
- Place the tray of chocolate cases into the freezer or fridge to set.
- Now make the peanut butter filling while the chocolate sets.
- To make the peanut butter filling, pour all of the ingredients into a bowl, remember to melt the coconut oil, and stir until smooth and combined.
- Spoon the mixture into the set chocolate cases, using a teaspoon of filling per case. Smooth the top and place back into the freezer or fridge to set.
- The chocolate will probably need a few seconds of heat to remelt it. Once the peanut butter filling has set, you can spoon half a teaspoon of the remaining melted chocolate over the top. Let it run to the edges of the cupcake cases, helping it along by sliding the spoon over the top. Place the tray back into the fridge and let them set completely. IT takes about an hour for the peanut butter to become more solid, but they are still delicious when they slightly runny too. 

_Store in an airtight container in the fridge._
