## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup coconut oil, melted
- 1/3 cup coconut flakes
- 1/3 cup flaked almonds
- 1/2 cup puffed millet (or puffed rice)
- 1/4 cup peanut butter 
- 1/4 cup cacao powder
- 3 Tbsp honey 
- 1 tsp vanilla essence
- Pinch of salt



## Method
- Line a 10cm x 20cm loaf tin with baking paper
- Start by roasting the flaked coconut and flaked almonds in a pan over medium heat. Stir occasionally to prevent them from burning. Remove it from the heat when it turns golden and you can smell a delicious roasted fragrance.
- Pour all of the ingredients into a bowl and mix until well combined.
- Spoon the chocolate mixture into your prepared loaf tin.
- Place the tin in the freezer for about 30 mins, or until set.
- Remove from the freezer, slice it into squares or bars, eat and enjoy.
