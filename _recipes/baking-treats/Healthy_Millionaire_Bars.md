## Ingredients
**Biscuit base**
-   1/2 cup coconut flour
-   1/2 cup oat flour (blend oats if you don't have)
-   3 Tbsp honey (or maple syrup)
-   1/2 cup coconut oil, slightly melted
-   Pinch of salt

**Caramel**
-   1/2 cup peanut butter
-   1/3 cup coconut oil
-   50ml honey (or maple syrup)
-   1 tsp vanilla
-   pinch of salt

**Chocolate Topping**
-   3 Tbsp coconut oil, melted
-   4 Tbsp cocoa powder
-   2 Tbsp honey
-   1/2 tsp vanilla

## Method
- Preheat the oven to 180 C.
- Line a loaf pan with baking paper, let it hang over the edges so that it is easy to lift the bars out once set.
- Pour all the ingredients for the **biscuit base** into a mixing bowl and mix until fully combined.
- Press the dough into the lined baking tin and bake for 10-12 minutes, until it turns a lovely golden brown. Set aside and let the base cool completely.
- To make the **caramel**, pour all the ingredients into a small pot on medium to low heat. Stir until it's all melted and fully combined. The mixture does not need to be boiled, it's just to make sure that all of the ingredients are melted and combined. This will take about a minute or two.
- Pour the cooled caramel over the cooled base and place in the fridge (or freezer if youâ€™re in more of a rush) to set.
- For the **chocolate topping**, mix all the ingredients in a bowl until fully combined. Pour over the set caramel layer. Place it back into the fridge to set. Once set, slice into bars, eat and enjoy.
