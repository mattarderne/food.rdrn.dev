title: Chocolate covered Peanut Butter crunch Balls
source: 
yield: 20 balls
time: 30 minutes
notes: You can use either rice crispies for puffed millet for a gluten free version. Nutribullet works but you need some patience to blend in batches.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup Medjool dates , pitted 
- 1/2 cup peanut butter , all-natural and drippy in texture
-  2 tablespoons flax or chia seeds , ground
- 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1 cup crisp rice cereal (rice crispies or puffet millet)
- Dark chocoalte for coating

## Method
- Place the pitted dates in the bowl of a large food processor and process until broken down.
-   Add in the peanut butter , the ground seeds, and salt, and process again until a crumbly, uniform dough is created.
- _if using a nutribullet_ Start by finely grinding the chia seeds and put in a large mixing bowl. Blend the dates with some peanut butter and coconut oil in small batches (it gets very sticky in the nutribullet) and then mix well in a mixing bowl. 
-   Add 1/3 of the cereal and  blitz quickly in the blender (don't turn to sand).
- Mix the rest of the whole crisp cereal into the mixture in the bowl. 
-   Use a tablespoon to scoop the dough and roll it between your hands to create 20 balls. Arrange them in a single layer on a plate or baking sheet and place them in the freezer to firm up.
-   Arrange a heat-safe bowl over a small saucepan filled with an inch of water to create a double-boiler. Bring the water to a boil and place the dark chocolate in the bowl to melt. Stir well, and remove the pan from the heat once melted.
-   Remove the peanut butter balls from the freezer and coat each one with melted chocolate. You can coat just the tops of each ball, or you can use the spoon to coat the bottoms, too. Place them on parchment paper to ensure that they will be easy to remove and serve later.
-   Serve chilled from the fridge or at room temperature. For best texture, I recommend storing these in the fridge until 30 minutes before you plan on serving them.
- They should keep well for up to 2 weeks in an airtight container in the fridge, if you don't eat them all before then.
