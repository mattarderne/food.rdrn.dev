title: Vegan peanut butter cookies
source: https://simple-veganista.com/vegan-peanut-butter-cookies/
yield: Up to 20 biscuits
time: 25 mins

## Ingredients
-  1 cup peanut butter (smooth or crunchy)
-   1 cup coconut sugar (can use normal sugar)
-   6 tablespoons almond/oats milk
-   2 teaspoons vanilla extract
-   1 cup gluten free flour (can use all purpose flour if not gluten free)
-   1 tsp baking soda
-   generous pinch of salt

## Method
- Preheat the oven to 180C. Line a cookie sheet with baking paper.

**Make the dough**
- In a large bowl, add the peanut butter and sugar and mix until creamy.
- Stir in the almond milk and vanilla. Next, add the flour, baking soda and salt, mix to combine. The dough will be tough to stir, using your hands to mix it together will be easier.

**Roll and flatten**
- Using a 1.5 tablespoon scooper, scoop out the dough and roll into balls, about 1 1/4 inch. Place the balls of dough about 2 1/2 inches apart on a baking sheet. Using the back of a fork, flatten in a crisscross pattern. Optionally, sprinkle with sugar or coarse salt.

**Bake**
- Place in the oven and bake for 10 – 13 minutes (13 minutes will yield a crispier cookie that’s tender inside). 
- Let cool a few minutes, transfer cookies to wire rack and repeat with remaining dough.
