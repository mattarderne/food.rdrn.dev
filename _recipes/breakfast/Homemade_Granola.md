## Ingredients
- 2 cups whole rolled oats
- 1/2 cup chopped almonds
- 1/2 cup mixed seeds
- 1/2 cup coconut flakes, optional
- 2 teaspoons cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
- 2 tablespoons melted coconut oil
- 1/4 cup honey/maple syrup
- 2 tablespoons peanut butter
- 1/3 cup dried cranberries, optional

## Method
- Preheat the oven to 150Â°c and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- In a medium bowl, combine the oats, walnuts, coconut flakes, if using, cinnamon, and salt. Drizzle in the coconut oil and maple syrup and add the almond butter. Stir until combined. Scoop the granola onto the baking sheet and press down to make clumps.
- Bake for 15 minutes, rotate the pan halfway, and use a fork to gently break the granola apart just a bit. 
- Bake for 15 minutes more, or until golden brown. Sprinkle with dried cranberries, if desired. Let cool for 15 minutes before serving.
