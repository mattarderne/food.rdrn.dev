## Ingredients
- 2 onions
- 2 courgettes
- 2 tbsp mild curry powder
- A thumb of ginger
- 2 garlic cloves
- A handful of coriander
- 4 tbsp olive, sunflower or coconut oil
- 50g coconut cream
- 1 tbsp demerara sugar
- 1 vegetable stock cube
- 500ml boiling water
- 150g dried red lentils
- 3 carrots
- 1 egg


## Method
- Peel and thinly slice the onions. Top and tail the courgettes then dice them into small pieces. 
- Make the curry paste. Spoon ½ tbsp mild curry powder into a small food processor. Peel and grate in the garlic and ginger. Separate the coriander leaves and stalks (save the leaves for later in the recipe), and add the stalks to the processor. Add in 1 tbsp oil and a pinch of salt and pepper. Blend till smooth. No processor? Prepare everything as above, but simply stir together. 
- Pour 1 tbsp oil into a pan and warm to a medium heat. Add the sliced onions and the curry paste. Fry for 5 mins, turning occasionally, till the onions are slightly softened. 
- Add the diced courgettes to the pan. Crumble in the coconut cream and vegetable stock cube and sprinkle in the sugar. 
- Pour in 500ml boiling water. Add the lentils. Stir everything together and bring to the boil. Cover and reduce to a simmer, then cook for 20-25 mins, till the lentils are tender and have thickened. 
- While the dahl is cooking, trim and peel the carrots. Coarsely grate the carrots into a bowl. Add ½ tbsp mild curry powder. Tear in the reserved coriander leaves and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Crack in the egg and stir to combine. 
- Pour 2 tbsp olive oil into a frying pan and warm to a medium-high heat. Drop large spoonfuls of the spiced carrot mixture into the pan. Fry for 3-4 mins, then flip the fritters over and cook for 3-4 mins on the other side. Transfer to drain on kitchen paper. 
- Taste the dahl and add a pinch of salt and pepper if needed. Spoon the daal into bowls and serve topped with carrot fritters.
