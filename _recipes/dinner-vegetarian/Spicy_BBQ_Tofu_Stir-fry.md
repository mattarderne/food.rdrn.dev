## Ingredients

- 1 Tb olive oil 
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 block tofu
- 1 cm fresh ginger
- 1 Tb rice vinegar 
- 1 Tsp sugar
- 8 grams plain flour
- 2 Tb Sriracha sauce 
- 1 Tb Sesame seeds
- 1/2 lime
- 1 bunch fresh coriander
- 4 Tb Soya sauce
- 2 Tb BBQ sauce
- 1 bag stir fry mix
- Optional: 1 bag egg noodles


## Method

**Prep:**
- a) Peel and grate the garlic. b) Zest and half the lime. c) Slice the tofu widthways into 2 thick 'steaks' per person. d) Roughly chop the coriander (stalks and all).

**Make stir-fry dressing:**
- a) Mix the easy ginger, garlic, olive oil, sugar  and half the soy sauce together in a small bowl. Squeeze in the juice from the lime and add rice vinegar. Stir to combine then set to one side. 

**Cook tofu:**
- a) Mix the BBQ sauce, sriracha and remaining soy sauce together in another small bowl.  b) Heat a drizzle of oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, lay the tofu slices into the pan and cook until golden, 4-5 mins on each side. Adjust the heat if necessary. c) Once the tofu is golden, turn off the heat and carefully pour in the BBQ sauce. Turn the tofu over in the sauce to evenly coat.

**Cook stir-fry & noodles:**
- If noodles aren't pre-cooked: a) pour the boiling water from your kettle into a large saucepan with a pinch of salt and bring back to the boil. b) Cook the noodles for 4 mins. Drain in a sieve. 
- Cook the stir-fry with the stir-fry sauce. 
-  Sprinkle the remaining sesame seeds all over the tofu. Serve the noodles onto plates and pop the tofu (and all the BBQ sauce!) on top.
