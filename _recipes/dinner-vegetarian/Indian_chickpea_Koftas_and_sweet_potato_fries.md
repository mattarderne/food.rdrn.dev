## Ingredients
- 1 lime
- 1 carrot
- 2 Tbs plain flour
- Mango chutney (optional)
- 1 Tbs cumin seeds
- 2 big tomatoes/8 small tomatoes
- 2 Tbs apple cider vinegar
- 1 bunch coriander
- 1 tin chickpeas
- 2 Tbs medium curry powder
- 2 sweet potatoes cut into chips
- 1/2 cucumber
- Mayonaise 
- 1 Tbs olive oil

## Method
**Prep Koftas:**
- Preheat your oven to 210Â°C. 
- Zest and halve the lime. Roughly chop the coriander (stalks and all). Trim and coarsely grate the carrot (no need to peel). 
- Drain and rinse the chickpeas. Pop the carrot, chickpeas and half the coriander in a large bowl. 
- Mix in the flour, North Indian curry powder and mango chutney. Season with salt and pepper. 
- Squish together with your hands (or the back of a fork) until the chickpeas are nicely broken up and mushy and the mixture sticks together. Keep to one side.

**Make sweet potato fries:**
- Lay the sweet potato fries out in a single layer on a baking tray.
- Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle on a splash of oil and half the cumin seeds. 
- Roast in the middle of your oven until golden, 18-20 mins. Turn half way through cooking.

**Make salad and sauce:**
- Cut and mix cucumber, tomatoes, fresh coriander salt, pepper and cumin seeds. 
- Drizzle with olive oil and vinegar.
- Squeeze a little of the lime juice into a bowl. Add a pinch of lime zest and the mayonnaise. Stir together to combine, keep to one side.

**Fry Koftas:**
- Heat a splash of oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. 
- Shape the chickpea mix into two balls per person. 
- Flatten each ball gently to 2cm thick and then fry in the hot oil until golden, 2-3 mins on each side. 
- Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm.
