- Perform four stretch & folds total - once every 30 mins. [example link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprDjPWuiN8)
- Bulk rise (until doubled) for about 6-8 hours. Temp should be ~ 23c, if much colder, leave for longer!
- Flour a counter, shape dough into a neat ball then put in fridge in floured basket or bread bin overnight, about 12 hours minimum.
- Let dough sit out while oven heats up to 260c. Do the finger indent test!
- Score, very lightly spray with warm water and place in oven with a lid (tinfoil lid fine, but make sure it has space to rise 50% or more)
- Lower oven to 230c and bake with lid for 25 mins. Then lid off for 25 mins.
- Don't cut until cool
