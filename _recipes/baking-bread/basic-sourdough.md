## Ingredients
- 400g All Purpose flour 
- 280g water (filtered, lukewarm)
- 60g starter (peaked)
- 8g salt (2%)
- Mixing bowl
- Bread tin / dutch oven / cake dish 
- Olive oil and parchment paper

## Method
- **Day 1**
- Mix water and flour. Let sit for 20-30 mins.
- Mix in starter. Let sit for 20-30 mins.
- Pour salt on top of dough, fold and pinch with wet hand until well combined.
- Perform four stretch & folds total - once every 30 mins. [example link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HprDjPWuiN8)
- Bulk rise (until doubled) for about 6 hours. Temp should be ~ 23c, if much colder, leave for longer!
- Flour a counter, carefully scrape dough out of bowl onto flour, shape dough into a neat ball.
- Spray parchment with olive oil and place into baking container, place the ball in the container. (the dough gets sticky overnight, so try keep things a bit oiled)
- Put in the fridge in overnight (ideally in a ziplock bag), about 12 hours minimum.
- **Day 2**
- Let dough sit out while oven heats up to 260c. Do the finger indent test to check if proved.
- Score with bread knife, _very_ lightly spray with warm water and place in oven with a lid (tinfoil lid fine, but make sure it has space to rise 50% or more)
- Lower oven to 230c and bake with lid for 25 mins. Then lid off for 25 mins.
- Don't cut until cooled down, lots still happening on the table.
