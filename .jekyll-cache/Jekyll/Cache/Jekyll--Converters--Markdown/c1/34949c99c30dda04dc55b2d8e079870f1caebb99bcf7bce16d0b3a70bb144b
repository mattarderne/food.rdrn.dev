  <li>9:30  add mature sourdough starter, mix thoroughly. cover and rest at 26°C for 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>10:00 add salt and mix thoroughly. cover and rest at 26°C for 15 minutes.</li>

  <li>12:30 - 15:15 allow dough to rest, covered, at 26°C for the rest of the bulk fermentation period. this period will range from 1.5 – 2 hours (or much longer), depending on ambient temperature, starter strength, and flour variety. End bulk fermentation when the dough is just under double in size.</li>
  <li>15:15 pre-shape. leave uncovered at room temperature for 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>15:35 final shape. transfer to rice floured banneton basket, cover with a plastic bag, and seal. allow to rest at room  temperature for 10 minutes before transferring to the fridge.</li>
